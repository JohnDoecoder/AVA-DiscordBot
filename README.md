# AVA Discord-Bot
AVA - Another Virtual Assistant.\
A private Discord-Bot I made for fun. The code is far away from perfect, but I don't care. It works!\
(At least most of the times)

## What can it do?
Mainly a bunch of unnecessary stuff.
But it has some cool features like a permission system, memes,
jokes and random pictures from thispersondoesnotexist.com.\
(It can also play music from YouTube with youtube__dl)

## What do I need in order to use it?
You need a discord API-Key (obviously) and a reddit API-Key to pull memes from reddit.
And since this bot is written in Python you need python3 (who would have thought...).\
Bot is tested on Debian Linux but should work on Windows too. 

## How do I use it?
Just clone the repo and fill in your credentials at `configuration/credentials.json`. Install all the requirements with
`pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Then execute `python3 main.py`.

## Commands
The bot reacts to old command (Default prefix is `!`), but also to slash commands.
Overall, there are around 50 commands to play around with, so have fun.
