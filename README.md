# Discord-Bot
A private Discord-Bot I made for fun.

## What can it do?
Mainly a bunch of unnecessary stuff.
But it has some cool features like memes, jokes and random pictures from thispersondoesnotexist.com.

## What do I need in order to use it?
You need a discord API-Key (obviously) and a reddit API-Key to pull memes from reddit. And since this bot is written in Python you need python (who would have thought...). (latest Python3 would be awesome)

## How do I use it?
Just clone the repo and fill in your credentials at configuration/credentials.json. Then execute the main.py with python 3. You may need to install a few dependencies, but nothing crazy.

## Dependencies
Idk. But something like
- praw
- discord
- bs4

would be helpful.
