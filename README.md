# Discord-Bot
A private Discord-Bot I made for fun

## What can it do?
A bunch of unnecessary stuff. But it has some cool features like memes, jokes and random pictures from thispersondoesnotexist.com.

## What do I need to use it?
You need a discord API-Key and a reddit API-Key

## How do I use it?
Just clone the repo and execute the main.py with python 3. You may need to install a few dependencies, but nothing crazy.
